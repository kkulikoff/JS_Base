***Module consumers!*** Frustrated by each module having its own wildly
unique README format? Annoyed by modules that omit critical sections like
**API** or **Examples**? Stuck scrolling through API docs before you *even know
what the module does*?

***Module authors!*** Tired of making up your readme format every time you
write it? Do you just want consistent readmes pre-populated with your module's
name, description and license without worrying about the structure every time?

What if there was a common format for the benefit of producers and consumers?

A *common readme* for node modules.
